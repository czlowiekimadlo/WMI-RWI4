This repository contains all source files for robot
constructed for PozRobot Student 2011 contest by
RWI team no. 4 - Panzerbesatzung

General configuration of robot is:
B,C - main motors for movement
A - manipulator servo


Due to calibration problems with PanzerBot 1.0 we had
to drop this design. Completely new robot, now with wheels
instead of caterpillars, will take part in competition.
New setup, with large wheels and different cogs for higher
speed, while significantly lacking in pushing power, turns
out to be better in running over obstacles.

As for contest programms, those are extremely simple, with
no sensors used at all.

Some of programs in repo are for testing purposes only
and may often change due to sensor ports reconfiguration
or something.
